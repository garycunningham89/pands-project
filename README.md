1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.
Quick google for finding a greater understanding of Iris Data Set returned the following which may be evaluated for approriateness for this assignment.

2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.

See above.

3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.

Cross check the excel and confirm data set for next stage.

4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.

Summarise using python when fully understood.

5. Write a summary of your investigations.

Summarise in written form the understanding after doing 1-4.

6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary 

Tables to be included also.
