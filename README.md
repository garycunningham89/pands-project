Respository for final project for Programming and Scripting module as part of Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.
Points of note:
Minimum Viable Project.
The minimum standard for this project is a GitHub repository containing a README
and a Python script. The README should contain a summary of the data set and your
investigations into it. It should also clearly document how to run the Python code you
used to investigate the data set, and what that code does. Furthermore, it should list
all references used in completing the project.
A better project will be well organised and contain detailed explanations. The analysis
will be well conceived, and examples of interesting analyses that others have pursued
based on the data set will be discussed.
Note that the point of this project is to use Python. You may use any Python
libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not. You should
not be thinking of using spreadsheet software like Excel to do your calculations.

Structure

1. Introduction

Ronald Aylmer Fisher's data set has been consulted in a vast range of articles and disciplines as noticeable during initial research. Ronald Fisher, himself was an English statistic-driven, genetic biologist who compiled the Iris Data Set as per this study. The 1936 study titled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" portrayed data on three different Iris species;- Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. The data compiled comprised of four features of each species, i.e. sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The total flowers contained in the data set were 150, split into 50 of each of the three species. All of the attribute information was measured in cm. The data set characteristics are summarized in the following list(Fisher, 1936, adapted from UCI Machine Learning Repository, Iris):

Classes: 3 - Species - Setosa, Virginica, Veriscolor.
No of Inputs: 150 - 50 of each class above.
Number of Attributes: 4 - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
Attribute Measurement: cm.
Analysis Type: Multivariate

The multivariate analysis type allows a range of measurement techniques on this data set as there are more than one variable and those variables are correlated (Olkin and Sampson, 2001). The intention of this project is to firstly, upload the data set, compile various calculations (using the Python programming language) of each variable of the data set and summarize the results with the aid of tables and diagrams where required.

4. Appendix/Appendices

Content
1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.



2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.

See above.

3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.

Cross check the excel and confirm data set for next stage.

4. Summarize the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.

Summarize using python when fully understood.

5. Write a summary of your investigations.

Summarize in written form the understanding after doing 1-4.

6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary 

Tables to be included also.
