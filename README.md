Respository for final project for Programming and Scripting module as part of Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.
Points of note:
Minimum Viable Project.
The minimum standard for this project is a GitHub repository containing a README
and a Python script. The README should contain a summary of the data set and your
investigations into it. It should also clearly document how to run the Python code you
used to investigate the data set, and what that code does. Furthermore, it should list
all references used in completing the project.
A better project will be well organised and contain detailed explanations. The analysis
will be well conceived, and examples of interesting analyses that others have pursued
based on the data set will be discussed.
Note that the point of this project is to use Python. You may use any Python
libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not. You should
not be thinking of using spreadsheet software like Excel to do your calculations.

Structure

1. Introduction

Ronald Aylmer Fisher's Iris data set has been consulted in a vast range of articles and disciplines as noticeable during initial research. Ronald Fisher, himself, was an English statistician firstly, with intrinsic ties to the studies of genetics, eugenics and biology as a whole who compiled the Iris Data Set as per this study(Yates and Mather(1963)). His studies have given him the affectionate title of "Father of Statistics", by some and he believed his various studies allowed greater ties between mathematics and biology as statistics, especially, are useful while trying to explain the various phenomena of science(Yates and Mather(1963)). His own 1936 study titled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" portrayed data on three different Iris flower species;- Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. The data compiled comprised of four features of each species, i.e. sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The total flowers contained in the data set were 150, split into 50 of each of the three species. All of the attribute information was measured in cm. The data set characteristics are summarized in the following list(Fisher, 1936, adapted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Iris data set:

Classes: 3 - Species - Setosa, Virginica, Veriscolor.
No of Inputs: 150 - 50 of each class above.
Number of Attributes: 4 - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
Attribute Measurement: cm.
Analysis Type: Multivariate

The multivariate analysis type utilized by Fisher allows a range of measurement techniques on this data set as there are more than one variable and those variables are correlated (Olkin and Sampson, 2001). The intention of this project is to firstly, upload the data set, compile various calculations (using the Python programming language) of various variables within the data set and summarize the results with the aid of tables and diagrams, where required, to attempt to explain its usefulness and its ties to machine learning and data analysis overall.

2. Body

THe research allowed consultations of various studies to aptly gain an understanding of Fisher his Iris data set and the importance in it as a tool for analysis. There are vast articles citing the Iris data set but I first went back to Fisher's initial 1936 study to gain an understanding of what he was trying to portray. The importance of the man himself was researched in Yates and Mather(1963) biography of him and then, with a basis to work upon, multiple articles and analysis were consulted to understand its importance. Use of this data set can allow experiences with machine learning, data mining and data analysis as a whole.

The analysis allowed portray different variations as seen in sepalwidth.. etc. These scripts were constructed with the help of articles... . , lecture content as part of the course and with further self directed learning from Python.org, w3schools.com and other websites for improvement of programming and scripting such as programiz, tutorialspoint and stackoverflow as shown in the reference list below. The iris data set was imported firstly from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repisotory and attempts were made to manipulate the data set using Python by creating outputs of the columns, rows, etc. and testing the max, min, mean, etc. The was a preliminary testing to try and gain an understanding of the data set while various scripts learned from previous. There were various studies consulted such as Kaggle, Dickerson, etc. as contained below to view their approach to such a study. My own approach was as follows:

1. Gain an understanding of Fisher, his Iris Data Set and its importance.
2. Extract and test the data set using Python to see the outputs and attempt to further understand why this data set is so popular.
3. Use Python to manipulate the data set for outputting various analysis using programs to output data, tables, graphs, etc.
4. Use my own outputs to explain Fishers Iris Data Set and its findings as accurately as possible.
5. Conclude these outputs with an explanation as to why Fishers Iris Data Set is so important and prevalent for data analysis now.
